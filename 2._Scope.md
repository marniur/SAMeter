# Scope

[Include a detailed description of this Working Group’s Scope.  This Scope is important is it establishes the bounds of each contributor's and licensee's patent commitment. For guidance on drafting an appropriate Scope, you may find [ISO's guidance (see page 5)](https://www.iso.org/files/live/sites/isoorg/files/developing_standards/docs/en/how-to-write-standards.pdf "ISO How To Write Standards Guide") helpful.]

# Project Charter - Super Advandced Smart Meter
The SAM specification consortium aims to create worldwide applicable smart meter specifications that focuses on basic metering functionality, country-specific functionality, third party functionality and integration capability for system operation applications. These standards and requirements should boost the development of the smart meter as a reliable virtual node in the energy grid enabling the energy transition and supporting new business models. It is of high importance that users, who are being measured, have access to their own data. The smart meter design is capable of measuring electricity, gas, water and heat. It further supports communication outside of the proximity, both for meteorological data as well as third party data communication. Thereby limiting the scope to the interface, any service thereafter is excluded from the SAM scope.
Focus on Gateway, which is the smart part and provides the functionality to connect meter reading separate meter functionality, to get around all legal requirements.

The scope hereafter is structured based on the five layers from the Smart Grid Architecture Model (SGAM)[https://ec.europa.eu/energy/sites/ener/files/documents/xpert_group1_reference_architecture.pdf, p. 26ff], it is not necessary to follow SGAM in detail or use this structure for the resulting specifications. For scoping purposes, each SGAM layer areas of application and their content are layed out to provide a structured approach.

Any changes of Scope are not retroactive. 




Refer to SGAM layers as design principles to be considered during the working group sepcifications.
