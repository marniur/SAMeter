# Scope

[Include a detailed description of this Working Groupâ€™s Scope.  This Scope is important is it establishes the bounds of each contributor's and licensee's patent commitment. For guidance on drafting an appropriate Scope, you may find [ISO's guidance (see page 5)](https://www.iso.org/files/live/sites/isoorg/files/developing_standards/docs/en/how-to-write-standards.pdf "ISO How To Write Standards Guide") helpful.]

# Project Charter - Super Advandced Smart Meter
The SAM specification consortium aims to create a worldwide applicable smart meter and respective data gateway specification that focuses on basic metering functionality, country-specific functionality, third party functionality and integration capability for system operation applications. These standards and requirements should boost the development of the smart meter as a reliable virtual node in the energy grid, enabling the energy transition and supporting new business models. It is of high importance that users, who are being measured, have access to their own data. The smart meter design is capable of measuring electricity. It further is capable of interfacing with gas, water and heat meters. It further supports communication outside of the proximity, both for meteorological data as well as third party data communication. This limits the interface scope and any WAN service thereafter is excluded from the SAM scope.
A special focus is put on the gateway, which is the smart part and provides the functionality to connect to the respective meters and enable communication towards LAN and WAN as well as translation between them via current and future standards.

Current and future standards that are referred to are curently researched and will be subsequently linked to this project for reference.

To provide an optional structure within the working groups specification, please reference to Design Principles (https://github.com/super-advanced-smart-meter/SAMeter/blob/main/2.2_Design%20Principles.md).

Any changes of Scope are not retroactive.
